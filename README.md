## **General considÃ©ration**

The goal of this projet is to build a complete dashboard with multiple widgets on multiple services (spotify / twitter / facebook...).

The client must be able to link his services with 2Oauth.
A refresh timer must be present for the widgets.

- The Client is available on ```http://localhost:3000/```
- Server is available on ```http://localhost:8080/```
- Mongo Admin is available on ```http://localhost:8081/```

## **Docker**

To build the project -> ```docker-compose build```
To run the project -> ```docker-compose up```

Client and Server have their own Dockerfile to build Reactjs and Nodejs environements

Docker compose at the root of the directory call them and expose them in the right port.
Docker compose also build mongo admin image.

He also build and sync the mongodb image used to store :
- User email
- User password
- User Tokens for each Api

## **Front-end**

We used ReactJS to develop the front end of our application.

Important librairies used :<br />
    - **MUI** (Material UI) -> For Design components like buttons or appbar<br />
    - **react-grid-layout** -> Principal grid of the dashboard<br />
    - **react-router**      -> To create client part routes (/register - /dashboard - /settings)<br />
    - **Redux**             -> To store user email easily on client part<br />
    - **Axios**             -> To do easier requests to server side<br />

## **Back-end**

We used NodeJS / Express to develop the back-end of our application.

Important librairies used :<br />
    - **Dotenv**        -> To store api client_id and client_secret keys<br />
    - **PassportJS**    -> To make 2OAuth authentifications with the services (Github / Spotify / Reddit / Google)<br />
    - **bcryptjs**      -> To encrypt password in the database when creating users<br />
    - **Snoowrap / github-api / spotify-web-api-node** -> Easier api calls and exceptions gesture to the different services<br />
